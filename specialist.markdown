## Artificer Specialist

Artificers pursue many disciplines. Here is a specialist option you can choose at 3rd level.

### Gunsmith

A Gunsmith specializes in using magic and technology to manufacture and wield firearms. This destructive power was valued by all armies of the Last War. Now that the war is over, many members of this specialization have hired themselves out as mercenaries, bodyguards, couriers, and assassins. 

#### Tool Proficiency
When you adopt this specialization at 3rd level, you gain proficiency with smith's tools. If you already have this proficiency, you gain proficiency with one other type of artisan's tools of your choice.

#### Gunsmith Spells
Starting at 3rd level, you always have certain spells prepared after you reach particular levels in this class, as shown in the Gunsmith spells table. These spells count as artificer spells for you, but they don't count against the number of artificer spells you prepare.

##### Gunsmith Spells
| Artificer Level | Spells |
|:-----:|:-------------|
| 3rd | _heroism_, _shield_ |
| 5th | _find steed_, _warding bond_ |
| 9th | _counterspell_, _nondetection_ |
| 13th | _death ward_, _locate creature_ |
| 17th | _intellect fortress_, _wall of force_ |

#### Battle Ready

When you choose this archetype at 3rd level, your combat training and your experiments with magic have paid off in two ways:

* You gain proficiency with martial weapons, including firearms.
* When you attack with a magic weapon, you can use your Intelligence modifier, instead of Strength or Dexterity modifier, for the attack and damage rolls.

You gain access to certain firearms after you reach particular levels in this class, as shown in the Firearms table.

#### Expertise

At 3rd level, choose one of your skill proficiencies or one of your tool proficiencies. Your proficiency bonus is doubled for any ability check that uses your chosen proficiency. 

At 6th level, you can choose one more of your proficiencies to gain this benefit.

```
```

#### Combat Superiority

When you choose this archetype at 3rd level, you learn maneuvers that are fueled by special dice called superiority dice.

**Maneuvers**. You learn eight maneuvers of your choice, which are detailed under "Maneuvers" at the end of this document. You can only use one maneuver per attack.

You learn two additional maneuvers of your choice at 5th, 9th, and 15th level. Each time you learn new maneuvers you can also replace one maneuver you know with a different one.

**Superiority Dice**. You have seven superiority dice, which are d4s. A superiority die is expended when you use it. You regain all your expended superiority dice when you finish a short or long rest. 

You gain two superiority dice at 5th level, one more at 9th level, and one more at 15th level. 

**Saving Throws**. Some of your maneuvers require your target to make a saving throw to resist the maneuver's effects. The saving throw DC is calculated as follows:

**Maneuver save DC** = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Strength, Dexterity, or Intelligence modifier (your choice)

##### Maneuver Versatility

You can replace one maneuver you know with a different maneuver whenever you finish a long rest. This change reflects your physical and mental preparation for the day ahead.


#### Extra Attack
Starting at 5th level, you can attack twice, rather than once, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn.

#### Close Quarters Shooter

You are trained in making ranged attacks at close quarters. Starting at 5th level, When making a ranged attack while you are within 5 feet of a hostile creature, you do not have disadvantage on the attack roll. Your ranged attacks ignore half cover and three-quarters cover against targets within 30 feet of you. Finally, you have a +1 bonus to attack rolls on ranged attacks.

#### Superior Critical

Your marksmanship improves. At 9th level, your firearm attacks score a critical hit on a roll of 18-20.

#### Improved Combat Superiority

At 15th level, your superiority dice turn into d6s.

Starting at 15th level, when you roll initiative and have no superiority dice remaining, you regain 1 superiority die.

#### Kill Shot

[At 15th level, your Arcane Jolt becomes more powerful. The extra damage of your Arcane Jolt increases to 4d6.]

## Maneuvers
The maneuvers are presented in alphabetical order. Unless the full text of a maneuver is provided here, each manuever is identical to those listed on page 74 of the _Player's Handbook_. Where maneuvers have been modified from the PHB, the modifications are shown in _italics_.

**Aim**. You carefully aim your next attack. As a bonus action, you give yourself advantage on your next attack roll on the current turn. Expend one superiority die and add the die to the attack roll. You can use this bonus action only if you haven’t moved during this turn, and after you use the bonus action, your speed is 0 until the end of the current turn.

<div class='descriptive'>
##### Steady, Fire, Aim!
Aim, unlike Precision Attack, consumes your Bonus Action and your movement. But it grants advantage _and_ adds a superiority die to the attack roll. Choose carefully! 
</div>   


**Ambush**. When you make a Dexterity (Stealth) check or an initiative roll, you can expend one superiority die and add the die to the roll.

**Bait and Switch**. When you’re within 5 feet of an ally on your turn, you can expend one superiority die and switch places with that ally, provided you spend at least 5 feet of movement. This movement doesn’t provoke opportunity attacks.

Roll the superiority die. Until the start of your next turn, the ally gains a bonus to AC equal to the number rolled.

**Disarming Attack**. When you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you can expend one superiority die to attempt to disarm the target, forcing it to drop one item of your choice that it's holding. You add the superiority die to the attack's damage roll, and the target must make a strength saving throw. On a failed save, it drops the object you choose. The object lands at its feet.

_You may instead attempt to grab the item from the creature. Using at least one free hand, you try to seize the creature's item by making a grappling check instead of an attack roll. Add the superiority die to your Strength (Athletics) check. If you succeed, you hold the creature's item instead of grappling the creature. If the item is a weapon, you may use it on your next attack it as long as you are proficient with it._

**Evasive Footwork**. Per PHB.

**Feinting Attack**. Per PHB.

**Interception**. When a creature you can see hits a target that is within 5 feet of you with an attack, you can use your reaction to reduce the damage the target takes by 1d10 + your superiority die + your proficiency bonus (to a minimum of 0 damage).

**Menacing Attack**. Per PHB.

**Parry**. If you are hit by an attack while wearing light or medium armor, you can expend one superiority die as a reaction, adding the number rolled to your AC. If the attack still hits, you take half damage from it.

**Precision Attack**. Per PHB.

**Rally**. Per PHB.

**Restraining Strike**. Immediately after you hit a creature with a melee weapon attack on your turn, you can expend one superiority die and use a bonus action to grapple the target (see chapter 9 in the _Player’s Handbook_ for rules on grappling). Add the superiority die to your Strength (Athletics) check. The target is also restrained while grappled in this way.

**Riposte**. When a creature misses you with a melee attack, you can use your reaction and expend one superiority die to make a melee _or ranged_ weapon attack against the creature. If you hit, you add the superiority die to the damage roll.

<div class='descriptive'>
##### "Un merdier très profond."
Several Gunsmith maneuvers allow you to make a ranged attack at close quarters. Standard rules for close quarters ranged attacks still apply unless you find a way to overcome disadvantage, such as _Close Quarters Shooter_ at 5th level.
</div>   

**Silver Tongue**. When you make a Charisma (Deception) check or a Charisma (Persuasion) check, you can expend one superiority die, and add the superiority die to the ability check.

**Skirmish**. When an enemy you can see moves within 5 feet of you, you can use your reaction to move up to half your speed. This movement does not provoke opportunity attacks. Expend one superiority die and make one weapon attack against that creature. If the attack hits, add the superiority die to the attack’s damage roll. You may make the weapon attack before, during, or after your movement. 

**Snipe**. As a bonus action, you can expend one superiority die and make a ranged weapon attack. You can draw a thrown weapon as part of making this attack. If you hit, add the superiority die to the attack’s damage roll.

**Studious Eye**. When you make a Wisdom (Insight) check or an Intelligence (Investigation) check, you can expend one superiority die, and add the superiority die to the ability check.

**Trick Up Your Sleeve**. You can use a bonus action on your turn to gain advantage on the next Dexterity (Acrobatics or Sleight of Hand) or Strength (Athletics) check you make during the same turn. Add the superiority die to the ability check.

**Trip Attack**. Per PHB.

## Infusions
The following infusions are added to the list of infusions you can learn as an artificer. 

#### Clockwork Bomb
_Prerequisite: 2nd-level artificer_

_Item: Clockwork toy_

You construct a tiny clockwork device (AC5, 1hp, move 20 feet, climb 10 feet, Stealth +6) and infuse it with explosive power. You may specify the appearance of the device, such as a dancing gnome or a walking music box. When you wind the device, specify the number of turns before it explodes. You may specify a path for the device as long as you can see, or are familiar with, its destination. The device may walk on any surface and climb walls. The device has your initiative and goes immediately after you in the iniative order.

Roll a tinker's tool DC 15 proficiency check, with the following results: on a successful check the device arrives at its destination and explodes at the end of its turn. On a failed check, the device detonates one round early for each point you failed the check. For example, if you set the device to walk for 10 rounds and roll a 13, the device will explode in 8 rounds. On a natural 1, the device explodes in your hands as you wind it.

<div class='descriptive'>

If the DM and player agree, the DM should roll this check out of the player's view.
</div>

When the device explodes each creature within a 20 foot radius must make a Dexterity save equal to your spell save DC. A target takes 3d6 thunder damage on a failed save and is deafened until the end of your next turn, or half as much damage on a successful one. 

The device may be disarmed with a successful DC 15 Thieves' Tools check. The device explodes immediately if hit by an attack.



#### Concussion Grenade
_Prerequisite: 6th-level artificer, Gunsmith specialist_

_Item: A rock or a pebble_

As an attack, a character can throw a grenade at a point up to 60 feet away. The grenade explodes on impact. Each creature within 20 feet of an exploding concussion grenade must make a Dexterity saving throw of DC 15 or your spell save DC, whichever is higher, taking 4d6 force damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one. Creatures that fail their save are stunned until the end of your next turn.

At 10th level, the force damage becomes 8d6 on a failed save. The infusion is consumed in the explosion.

#### Mechanized Armor
_Prerequisite: 6th-level artificer, Gunsmith specialist_

_Item: Breastplate armor_

Mechanized armor functions as medium armor with AC 14 and weighs 20 pounds. While wearing mechanized armor:
* A  creature gains a +1 bonus to Armor Class.
* A creature may apply a maximum Dexterity modifier of 3 to its armor class, instead of 2. 
* The armor has hit points equal to your Constitution modifier + your Intelligence modifier + five times your level in this class. These hit points are treated as temporary hit points for the creature wearing the armor.
* **Repair (3/Day)**. You may use your bonus action to restore 2d8 + 2 hit points to the mechanized armor.
* If the _mending_ spell is cast on it, the mechanized armor regains 3d8 hit points.

Your tinkering improves the lightness and durability of the mechanized armor. When you reach 10th level in this class: 
* The mechanized armor weighs 10 pounds.
* The mechanized armor gains a +2 bonus to Armor Class.
* The maximum Dexterity modifer increases to 5.
* **Deflect Attack**. The creature wearing the armor may use its reaction to impose disadvantage on the attack roll of one creature it can see. If the attack hits, the creature wearing the armor may halve the attack's damage against it.

When you reach 14th level in this class:
* Your mechanized armor gains a +3 bonus to Armor Class.
* Whenever your mechanized armor uses its Deflect Attack, the attacker takes force damage equal to 1d4 + your Intelligence modifier if the attacker is within 5 feet of the creature wearing the armor.

#### Improved Repeating Shot
_Prerequisite: 10th-level artificer_

_Item: A simple or martial weapon with the ammunition property (requires attunement)_

This infusion grants all of the benefits of the Repeating Shot infusion (_Eberron_ p. 62). When you reach 10th level in this class, the attack and damage bonus increases to +2. When you reach 14th level in this class, the attack and damage bonus increases to +3.

## Firearms

Firearms are martial ranged weapons. 

When you discharge a firearm with the _long_ property within 5 feet of your target, you do so with disadvantage, even if you are trained as a Close Quarters Shooter or Crossbow Master.

You may use the butt of a firearm as an improvised melee weapon that deals 1d4 damage. You may treat the weapon as a club and use your proficiency bonus for the attack roll. This attack does not count as a magical attack, and you must use your Strength modifier to calculate damage.  

You may not reload a firearm while wielding a shield, even if the firearm is magically infused.

Rolling a 1 results in a misfire. You must use an action to clear the jam, even if an ability otherwise allows you to ignore the reload property.


<div class='wide' style='margin-top:1px'>
##### Firearms
| Weapon | Level | Cost | Damage | Weight | Properties
|:------------- |:------|:------|:-------------|:-------------|:-------------|
| Revolver  | 3rd | 250 gp | 2d6 piercing | 3 lb. | Ammunition (range 40/120), reload (6 shots) |
| Shotgun  | 5th |  500 gp | 2d8 force | 7 lb. | Ammunition (range 30/90), reload (2 shots), two-handed |

## Artificer Feature Variants

These features replace or enhance the normal features of the artificer. The class feature variants each specify which feature they replace or enhance. If a feature is replaced, you gain no benefit from it and don’t qualify for anything in the game that requires it. If a feature is enhanced, you continue to enjoy its benefits but now with new capabilities. 

If an existing feature with the same name has been modified to fit the artificer, the modifications are shown in _italics_.

#### Firearm Proficiency
_1st-level artificer feature (replaces optional Firearm Proficiency)_

Artificers are _not_ proficient with firearms.

While you are wearing armor, you gain a +1 bonus to AC.

#### Dueling

When you are wielding a melee weapon in one hand and no other weapons, you gain a +2 bonus to damage rolls with that weapon.

#### Great Weapon Fighting

When you roll a 1 or a 2 on a damage die for an attack you make with a melee weapon that you are wielding with two hands, you can reroll the die and must use the new roll, even if the new roll is a 1 or a 2. The weapon must have the two-handed or versatile property for you to gain this benefit.

#### Unarmed Fighting

_You have learned your foes' weak points._ Your unarmed strikes can deal bludgeoning damage equal to 1d6 + your Strength _or Intelligence modifier_. If you strike with two free hands, the d6 becomes d8.

When you successfully start a grapple, you can deal 1d4 bludgeoning damage to the grappled creature.

```
```
### Reliable Talent

By _14th_ level, you have plundered magical knowledge from a wide spectrum of disciplines. Choose two spells from any class, including this one. A spell you choose must be of a level you can cast, as shown on the _Artificer_ table, or a cantrip.

The chosen spells count as _artificer_ spells for you.

You learn two additional spells from any class at 18th level.

Courier, bodyguard, kidnapper, thug. You go by many different names, not all of them kind. But you are a _transporter_. 

Many transporters swear fealty to the dragonmarked house of Orien. The lightning rails and elemental vessels of Eberron are a second home to you.

## Design Notes for the Gunsmith aka "The Transporter"
### Inspiration

"I'm not getting killed for your merchandise. Buckle up."—The Driver

Pets suck. They're extra work to keep track of and they don't fit the flavor I'm looking for. The first version of the Gunsmith was a modified Battle Smith that removed _Steel Defender_ and added a variety of new and existing Battle Master maneuvers, with the following fiction for flavor inspiration:

* The Driver (Clive Owen) in BMW's The Hire series (https://youtu.be/GW11Lez4elc).
* Frank Martin (Jason Statham) in The Transporter (https://youtu.be/P5n8zY-vG4U).
* Roland the Gunslinger from the early Stephen King novellas—not the movie.
* ... with a bit of Mike Ehrmantraut thrown in.

The Steel Defender has two functional elements:

* Offensive. The pet attacks every round as a bonus action and deals a non-trivial amount of damage (see chart). Replace offensive features with maneuvers.
* Defensive. The pet absorbs a ton of damage (nearly 100 HP at 17th level!) Replace defensive features with mechanized armor infusions.

This specialist now dispenses entirely with the Battle Smith and builds a Gunsmith from the ground up.

Protagonists in the source lore are not superheroes but they always have a trick up their sleeve. This is reflected in the high number of maneuvers known (8!), the large pool of superiority dice (7!) and the small die (d4). Design maneuvers to nudge toward the desired outcome, not guarantee success. A Gunsmith should not be able to out-fight a fighter, but he should be able to outwit him. Use the Gunsmith's large dice pool to provide a flexible & creative play-style at the expense of raw power.


### Suggested Backgrounds and Builds
Core elements of the persona: quick-witted, dexterous, mission-driven. The Gunsmith lives by a code and is seldom chaotically aligned. 

This build modifies the modern and Renaissance firearms from the _Dungeon Master's Guide_ page 268. Be careful about multiclass cheese! The Transporter is intended for play in Eberron and might not fit well in the Forgotten Realms.

The following Dragonmarks are a good fit for the Gunsmith: the Mark of Finding, the Mark of Making, the Mark of Passage, the Mark of Sentinel, and the Mark of Warding.

Consider the following backgrounds for your character: House Agent, Mercenary Veteran, Veteran Bounter Hunter, Soldier, Charlatan, Criminal, Urchin, City Watch, Faction Agent, or Transporter. 


```
```

### Compared to the Battle Master
In the following tables "Damage per Short Rest" represents the sum of the average marginal damage provided exclusively by superiority dice. Fighter 15th and 18th level assumes one battle per short rest in which the fighter is out of dice. The sum assumes that every attack hits.

##### Battle Master Maneuvers
| Level | Maneuvers | dSize | Dice | Dmg / Short Rest
|:----:|:-------------|:-------------|:-------------|:-------------|
| 3rd  | 3 |d8 |4 | 18 |
| 7th  | 5 |d8 |5 | 22.5 |
| 10th | 7 |d10 |5 | 27.5 |
| 15th | 9 |d10 |6† | 38.5 |
| 18th | 9 |d12 |6 | 45.5 |

† Starting at 15th level, when you roll initiative and have no superiority dice remaining, you regain 1 superiority die.

##### Gunsmith Maneuvers
| Level | Maneuvers | dSize | Dice | Dmg / Short Rest
|:----:|:-------------|:-------------|:-------------|:-------------|
| 3rd  | 8 |d4 |7 | 17.5 |
| 5th  | 10 |d4 |9 | 22.5 |
| 9th | 12 |d4 |10 | 25 |
| 15th | 14 |d6 |11† | 42 |

† Starting at 15th level, when you roll initiative and have no superiority dice remaining, you regain 1 superiority die.

### Compared to the Steel Defender
Are maneuvers are underpowered compared to the Steel Defender?

##### Steel Defender Stats
| Level | HP | Rend Dmg / Rnd | Dmg / Short Rest
|:----:|:-------------|:-------------|:-------------|
| 3rd  | 20 |6 | 60 |
| 5th  | 27 |7 | 70 |
| 9th | 54 |17 | 170 |
| 13th | 75 |18 | 180 |
| 15th | 85 |25 | 250 |
| 17th | 96 |26 | 260 |

Assumptions:
* Artificer INT of 16 at 3rd level, 18 at 5th level, and 20 at 9th level.
* Rend takes your bonus action. Assumes 10 attacks per short rest.

## Scenarios

The following scenarios demonstrate Gunsmith abilities in play.

### Scenario 1: The Debt

A **Hobgoblin Captain** spots the Gunsmith (3rd level, standard array, half-plate +1 AC 18, 22hp, revolver +1, returning dagger +1) in the street from a distance of fifteen feet. The Captain has come to collect a debt. The Gunsmith knows this will be settled with blows, not words. 

#### Roll Initiative

* Gunsmith: 8
* Captain: 5

####  1st Round

Gunsmith bonus action _snipes_ and throws dagger at the Captain. 15 (miss). Gunsmith draws his revolver and shoots. 21 (hit). _Menacing attack_. 8 damage.

Captain rolls 19 and makes his save. Captain draws his greatsword and approaches to within 5 feet. Gunsmith uses his reaction to _skirmish_ before Captain can attack him, moves 17 feet away and shoots Captain. 18 (hit). 13 points of damage.

Captain uses the rest of his movement to close the distance and attacks twice with his greatsword: 16 (hit) and 11 (miss). 6 damage.

#### 2nd Round

Gunsmith realizes he's at disadvantage within 5 feet so uses a _feint_ attack to cancel disadvantage. Shoots Captain point blank, rolls 18 (hit). 13 damage.

Captain morale check 17 (pass). He's no coward, and attacks the Gunsmith with his greatsword, rolls a 16 (miss). Gunsmith _ripostes_, shooting at disadvantage, rolls a 4 (miss). Captain attacks again, rolls 14 (miss).

#### 3rd Round

Gunsmith has two superiority dice remaining. He _feints_ again and shoots, rolls 1&mdash;misfire!.

Captain attacks, rolls 1 (miss). Gunsmith _ripostes_ with his last superiority die, attempting to hit Captain with the butt of his pistol. He rolls a 3 (miss). He's out of dice and out of luck.

Captain attacks again, rolls 7 (miss!)

#### 4th Round 

Gunsmith can't afford an action to clear his jam. He tries to club the Captain with his pistol, rolls 11 (miss).

Captain sniggers because he knows he's got his man. Attacks with greatsword, twice. Rolls 18 (hit), 8 damage. Swings again, rolls 9 (miss).

#### 5th Round 

Gunsmith tries to club the Captain with his pistol, rolls 9 (miss!)

Captain swings twice with his greatsword, rolls 6 (miss!) and 17 (miss!!)

#### 6th Round

Gunsmith clubs the Captain with his pistol, rolls 21 (hit). 6 damage, and the Captain crumples into the street, dead.

The Gunsmith knows he was lucky, not good. He realizes he could have cast _shield_ in round four to avoid being hit. He thanks the gods of chance and vows to fight smarter next time. 

### Scenario 2: The Hostage

A Gunsmith (5th level, standard array, breastplate +1 AC 17, 33hp, shotgun +1, returning dagger +1) is tasked with rescuing a hostage. He knows the hostage, a **noble**, has been kidnapped by a **Hobgoblin Captain** and a **Hobgoblin**. He also knows the kidnappers have been instructed to kill the hostage rather than allow her to be recaptured. Finally, through his underworld contacts he has learned the date and time the kidnappers plan to transfer the noble to a new location.

The Gunsmith dons _breastplate_ so he can be stealthy, even though _half plate_ would give him better protection. He knows the odds are long, but he has a plan.

He is a Transporter.

#### Before the Fight

The Gunsmith casts _guidance_ on himself and hides in an alley, waiting for the kidnappers and the noble to come within 30 feet. When they are within range, he steps out of the alley and attempts to surprise them. He rolls a Dexterity (Stealth) check of 22 and startles the Hobgoblins as he levels the shotgun at them.

Gunsmith takes his second shot, this time at the Captain, rolls 19 with the help of a _precision attack_ (hits). 14 damage.

Captain is surprised and does nothing.

Noble is surprised and does nothing, to the Gunsmith's frustration.
